60 FIFTY LETTERS OF CICERO

Again he devoted himself mainly to quiet work. The years
B.C. 46, 45, 44 constitute the period of his greatest literary pro-
ductiveness.

(From Rome, May 5, ΒΕ. 43, to Plancus in Transalpine Gaul.)

Planco: L. Munatius Plancus, by Caesar’s appointment in

command of Transalpine Gaul. He did not, however, go there >

Horace’s odes (Ι. 7) is addressed to him.

31 l ante Victoriam : over Antony, who was besieging Deci-
mus Brutus in Mutina. After the murder of Caesar the leading
conspirators lingered for a time in Rome and then separated in
various directions, some to take charge of provinces which had

Cisalpine Gaul. By a later arrangement Antony had got this
province assigned to himself.

Mutina, Antony raised the siege and marched towards the Alps
with the intention of joining Lepidus, governor of Gallia Nar-
bonensis and Hither Spain.
