17 3 Quid agit: cf. note, 10 4.
17 3 Attica nostra: a pet name. Atticus had been adopted

by his mother's brother, Q. Caecilius, and so his proper name,
according to the custom of adoptions, was Q. Caecilius Pom-
ponianus, and his daughter’s name, according to the custom for
women, was Caecilia.

17 4 nullas: sc. litteras.
17 5 nec . . . fuerat: and perhaps there was πο reason sor

commg.

Atticus in Rome and Cicero on his Tusculan estate.

Cicero’s letters to these men, who had accompanied young

Marcus, Cicero's son, to Athens.

sion in speaking of the death of a friend.

At the time of this letter (BC. 46) Caesar was in full power, and
Cicero was hesitating whether he should take part in the delib-
erations of the senate.

18 3 ut ne: a combination sometimes found (not in Caesar,
Sallust, or Livy), equivalent to the simple ne.

herself in the matter of a second wife for Cicero, Terentia
having been recently divorced.
