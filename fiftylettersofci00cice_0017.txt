THE LETTERS EXTANT

INCLUDING 98 addressed to Cicero, 8641 letters have been
preserved, in four collections, as follows:—

Ad Familiares ........ XVI books
Ad Atticum ......... XVI “
Ad Quintum fratrem ..... ΙΙΙ

Ad M. Brutum ....... ΙΙ

The title Ad Familiares is neither of classical authority nor
entirely appropriate, but it has become universally adopted.
The letters to Atticus were probably arranged for publication
by hirn; the others probably by Tiro. Several collections,
containing perhaps quite as many letters as remain, have been
lost.

¹ Editors do not agree in the method of counting the number of letters.
For example, Att. xvi. 16 (containing copies of six letters written by Cidero to
other correspondents and inclosed in the note to Atticus) makes seven numbers
in Professor Tyrrell's edition.
