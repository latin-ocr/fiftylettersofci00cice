NOTES ωωγ Sl

Cicero's banishment seems to have been brought about by an
interesting interplay of personal feelings and sharp politics. The
triumvirs and their supporters were perhaps not sorry to be
rid for a time of Cicero with his old-fashioned notions of the

republic, and Clodius found the means of satisfying them and his
own spite by bringing forward against Cicero the execution of
the Catilinarian conspirators without a regular trial.

The bill proposed by Clodius early in the year of his tribunate,
B.C. 58, was to the effect that any one who should be found to have
executed Roman citizens without formal trial “should be inter-
dicted from the use of fire and water‚” ut ei aqua et igni inser-
diceretur, the usual formula of banishment. Cicero left Rome
in the latter part of March, before the passage of the bill. In
its stead, after his departure, a special bill against him was
passed, modified by the efforts of his friends so as to limit the
interdict to a distance of 400 miles from Rome.

The five following letters were written during his exile.

39. (Att. 111. 3.)

(On the way to Vibo, the modern Monte Leone, in southern Italy, April,
B.c. 58, to Atticus at Rome.)

21 17 Vivere coegisti: i.e.‚ prevented him from committing
suicide.

21 19 converti iter: his first intention had been to leave
Italy by way of Brundisium. At the present writing he had in
mind to go to Sicily or Malta; but no definite plans were yet
formed, as the next sentence shows. In the following letter we
find him on the road to Brundisium.

40. (Att. 111. 4.)

(On the way from Vibo to Brundisium, April, 1=.C.5S‚ to Atticus at Rome.)

22 2 a Vibone: from the estate of his friend Sicca (men-
