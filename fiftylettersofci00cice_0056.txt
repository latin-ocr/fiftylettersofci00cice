38 FIFTY LETTERS OF CICERO

another letter to Tiro (Fam. XVI. 4) Cicero wrote : cum valetudini
tuae dilzgrentissime consulueris, tum, mi Tiro, consulito navigationi.

6 5 dabis: the future as imperative, taking obedience as a
matter of course.

6 6 praetermitto ζ SC. quin ei dem ad te litteras.

6 7 simul: Sc. nobiscum.

6 7 nihil est quod: see second note, 1 6.

6 9 Actio : from Actium ,· see note, 5 4. It was off this point
that the famous battle was fought B.C. 31, in which Octavian
defeated Antony and Cleopatra.

14. (Fam. XVI. 7.)

6 12 mirum in modum : a form of expression not uncommon
in Cicero. He has maiorem in modum, incredibilem in modum,
miserandum in modum, hostilem in modum, hilarem in modum,
and others.

6 13 litterarum: partitive genitive with m‘lzz'l.

6 13 iis . . . essent ε sor is those winds were blowing by wlzz'clz
one sails from wliere you are, i.e., from the southeast. Observe
that in translating we change the case and place of ils ventis
and qui. ο

6 15 per: considering. This restrictive sense of per, so ar
as regards, is akin to an idiomatic use of our for‚· e.g.‚per me
vel stertas licet, for me, sor my part, for all l care, you may snore
if you want to.

6 17 Nemo . . . diligat ε no one loves me but lias a lzzgrlz regar-d
sor you; amare is stronger than dilzgere. Cicero might have
used quin. The subjunctive is characteristic,

6 17 carus . . . venies ζ “you will be dear and welcome to all
when you come ’⁹ (Gildersleeve).

15. (Fam. XVI. 15.)

6 21 belle habere: with or without reflexive, doing well, in
good lzealtlz.
