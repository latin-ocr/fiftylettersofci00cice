NOTE ΟΝ LETTER WRITING

A DESCRIPTION of the mechanical part of ancient letter writing
may be found in any classical dictionary. ln Cicero’s time two
methods were in use. (Ι) There were tablets, of wood or
ivory, spread with dark-colored wax, two or more being fastened
together on the edge so as to shut up like a double slate. The
writer used a stilus, of metal or bone, sharp at one end, and
generally flat at the other end for erasing. (2) Cicero probably
used more frequently a paper made from the Egyptian papyrus
plant. The sheets, generally about the size of a large duodecimo
page, were pasted together at a side edge‚ according to the num·
ber needed. Reed pens (calami) and ink (atramentum) were
used, and the letter was rolled in the manner of ancient books.
