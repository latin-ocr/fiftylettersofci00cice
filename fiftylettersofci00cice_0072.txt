It was not until August 4 of the following year that the reso-
lution for Cicero’s recall was finally passed, and then his friends
succeeded only by assembling the Italian voters from the munici-
pia. In B.C. 57 Caesar was busy in Gaul. Pompey was at odds
with Clodius and now exerted himself in Cicero’s behalf. The
decision was hailed with joy by the senatorial party, and Cicero
returned to Rome amid great demonstrations in his honor.

He soon found, however, that spectacular applause did not
necessarily mean power. Seeing his inability to stem the trend
of public affairs under the dominating influence of the triumvirs‚
he took little part in politics for the next few years, and in this
period produced his first important literary works. Cf. note,

30 20.
