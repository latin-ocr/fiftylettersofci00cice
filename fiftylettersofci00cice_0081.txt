NOTES 63

probably in October. A few weeks later, in December, B.C. 43,
near his ⁴Formian villa, Cicero suffered the same fate. Plutarch
has given a minute, impressive description of the closing scene.

“In three years the tyrannicides of the ides of March, with
their aiders and abettors‚ were all dead, some killed in battle,
some in prison, some dying by their own hand‚— slain with the
daggers with which they had stabbed their master.

‘⁶ Out of the whole party the fate of one only deserves special
notice,——a man whose splendid talents have bought forgiveness
for his faults, and have given him a place in the small circle of
the really great whose memory is not allowed to die.”

qude's Caesar, ch. xxvii, p. 418.
