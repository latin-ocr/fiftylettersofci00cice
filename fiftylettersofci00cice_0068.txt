50 FIFTY LETTERS OF CICERO

publica m‘lzil habeo ad te scribere, nisi summum odium omnium
hominum (a wish father to the thought) in eos qui tenent omnia
(the triumvirs); mutationis tamen spes nulla. Sed, quod facile
sentias, taedet ipsum Pompeium vehementerque paenitet. The fact
was that Pompey, unlike Caesar, had no clear conviction in politi-
cal matters, and saw things only as they affected him personally.

20 18 deinde: correlative with preceding primum, the sen-
tence following being also dependent upon scire volo.

20 19 nullo . . 2 consenescere: though nobody takes tlze lead
against tlzem, are playing ont, an instance of Cicero's fatal
inability to gauge public sentiment.

20 20 consensionem . . fuisse: unanimz'ty on the part of
all, botlz in feeling and in expression, was never greater.

20 23 totos: wholly. The English idiom frequently calls for
an adverbial translation of the Latin adjective.

20 24 ex quo . . . versamur: connyuently, as yon may
imagine, l am involved in tlte frequent mentiouiug and fond
recollectien (ff my former deeds. Some take it to mean, “ people
often talk of what Ι did in former times, and wish them back
again ” (Merivale).

21 3 βοώπιδοςῑ (boopi(los, ox-eyed)‚ (ff our sest-eyed one,
Clodia, sister of Cicero’s enemy Clodius (consanguineus).

21 5 ceteris . . . ostentat: to others lle openly asserts and
parades illem, i.e.‚ his threats (terrores) against Cicero.

21 10 ponam: Irely.

21 13 permagni . . . interest: it is of tlze greatest importance
to me: see note, 13 1⁶2. The degree of concern may be expressed
by a genitive of value, as here, or by an adverb or an adverbial
accusative.

21 13 comitiis: usually hel-d in July, but this year, as we
learn from another letter (Att. II. 20), postponed to October.

21 14 declarato illo: after lle is declared elected, i.e.‚ Clodius
as tribune, an event that presaged the great humiliation of
Cicero's life, his banishment. The story of Clodius’s escapade,
his trial, and subsequent hostility to Cicero may be read in any
Roman history.
