NOTES 55

44. (Fam. III. 2.)

(From Rome, B.C. 51, to Appius Claudius Pulcher, proconsul in Cilicia.)

Imp.: Imperatori.

26 8 contra . . . opinionem: in ΒΕ. 52 a law was enacted that
consuls and praetors should not take charge of a province until
five years after their term of office had expired. This law had
the effect of bringing into service former consuls and praetors
who had not been provincial governors, and Cicero was of this
number. He had been twelve years out of office, had once given
up the desirable province of Macedonia, and but for the new law
would not have been called upon thus late to undertake a pro-
vincial government.

26 9 cum imperio z wille militam command.

26 12 quod . . . accipere: that 720 one could succeea' you more
friendly to you tlzan l am, and llzat l could (sc. possem) receive
tlte province from 720 one, etc. In Fam. ΙΙΙ. 3, he wrote: ut
onmes intellegant nec me benevolentzori cuiquam succedere nec te
amiciori potuisse provinciam tradere.

26 14 aptam explicatamque: in good order and free from
dffculties.

26 17 coniunctione: both being members of the college of
augurs.

26 21 rationibus meis: sor my interests. Appius failed
entirely to comply with this request.

26 23 eius: partitive genitive, neuter.

26 24 quasi . . . temporis: running tlte course, if l may use
tlze expression, of my term os effice.

27 8 intellexero: see note, 4 16.

In the early part of May, B.C. 51, Cicero set out for his prov-
ince. In contrast with Appius, he administered its affairs with
quite unusual honesty and fairness, reducing the burdens and
respecting the rights of the provincials.

His year of office ended July 30, B.C. 50, and he sailed
August 3. He returned by way of Rhodes, Ephesus, and Athens,
and landed at Brundisium November 26.
